This problem tests your understanding of how
to reason about negations. Show that if *P* is
false the so is *P ∧ Q.

This problem tests your understanding of classical
reasoning using the axiom of the excluded middle.
You are to prove this proposition by case analyis
using the axiom of the excluded middle. There are
of course four cases: P and Q both true, only one
or the other true, and both false.

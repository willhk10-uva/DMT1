To understand what it means for an endorelation to be well
founded, we need the notion of what it means for an element,
*(x : α)* to be *accessible* under a given relation, *r*.

Think of *r* as being some kind of *one smaller than* relation.
We will write *y is one smaller than x (under r)* as *r y x*.
One could call such a relation, *precedes*, and use an infix
notation, *y ≺ x*, to mean *y precedes x by one step under r*.

Now the question is whether the process of going from *x*,
through *r*, to *y*, `and then from *y* to an even smaller *z*
can be repeated forever. If so, then *x* is *not* accessible.
On the other hand, you are guaranteed eventually to hit some
*smallest* element, from which you can *descend* no further,
the *x* is said to be *accessible* (from that smallest value).

This notion will be crucial in establishing that it is okay,
(a) to use recursion down through the relation *r* as it will
terminate, or (b) that one is not inadvertently specifying an
infinite structure, as values of inductive types in Lean are
always finite by definition.

Here are two examples. First,  consider the predecessor relation
on the natural numbers. Every natural number, *a*, is accessible
under it, as you can only move from *a* down to its predecessor,
and from there further down, a finite number of times before you
reach zero and can go no further down. In other words, there is
*no infinite descending chain* from *x*. But on the other hand,
no number is accessible in the *integers*, because from any value
you can keep subtracting one forever, always with a new result.

Given any endorelation *r* on *α*, the property of a value,
*(x : a)*, being accessible is defined formally as follows.

```lean
inductive Acc {α : Sort u} (r : α → α → Prop) : α → Prop where
  | intro (x : α) (h : (y : α) → r y x → Acc r y) : Acc r x
```
Given the proposition that *x* is accessible under *r*, written
formally as *Acc r x*, it is valid, and a proof is obtained by
applying the *Acc.intro* (proof) constructor:

```lean
intro (x : α) (h : (y : α) → r y x → Acc r y) : Acc r x
```

What it says,reading from right to left, is that to prove
*Acc r x* it will suffice to apply *Acc.intro* to *x* and
to a proof, *h*, of the proposition that if any value, *y*,
that is one step smaller than *x* is accessible, then *x* is
too.  That makes sense because if such a *y* is accessible,
there can be no infinite descending chain from any such *y*,
and so any chain down from *x* must be finite, as well, being
just one *step* longer than a chain down from *y*. In sum, if
every value that is one step smaller than *x* is accessible,
then so is *x*.

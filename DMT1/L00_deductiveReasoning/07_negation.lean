# Negation (¬)

## Big Idea from Last Time

- one pigeon is no holes is impossible (pigeonhole principle)
- (P → Empty), (P → False) uninhabited unless P is uninhabited
- So if (P → Empty), (P → False), then P must be uninhabited
- In Type uninhabited means empty. In Prop is means false.
- Empty : Type and False : Prop are given uninhabited types

## New Idea: Not (¬)

- Suppose α and P are uninhabited types / propositions
  - { α : Type } (pEmpty : α → Empty)
  - { P : Prop } (pFalse : P → Prop)
@@@ -/

axiom α : Type
axiom P : Prop

### Optional Side-Note

- Type is Type 0 is Sort 1
- Prop is Sort 0

You can generalize with `Sort u`

### Negation Introduction

#### Logical case
  - Knowing that P is uninhabited
  - Means knowing there is no proof of it
  - Means knowing for sure that it's false
  - Now we'd like to say *Not p* is true
  - A perfect proof: *pFalse : P → False*
  - We *define* *(Not P)* to be *P → False*

-- def Not (a : Prop) : Prop := a → False

Just as *∧ : Prop → Prop → Prop* is notation
for *And _ _*, mathematics and logic use the
unary prefix notation, ¬P, to mean (Not P),
which, in turn, means *P → False*. These are
all the same proposition.

#reduce (types := true) ¬P
#reduce (types := true) Not P
-- P → False

We cannot overemphasize the importance of very
quickly learning to translate between *¬P* and
*P → False* as meaning exactly the same thing.
In particular, a proof of *¬P* is a *function*
(of type P → False).

What does this mean? Suppose you have your own
uninhabited logical type (proposition), *Wrong,*
with no proofs. What interesting new proposition
should we be able to prove about *Wrong*?

# Expressing Richer Ideas

This document as posted includes notes taken in real
time.

<!-- toc -->

To formally represent richer, more interesting, and
practically important ideas, we need more than just
*And* as a proposition-building connective and the
three inference rules for *And* (introduction and two
elimination rules). Even for the purposes of the last
chapter we needed implication and equivalence to say
what we wanted.

As a preview of work coming soon we now discuss each
of these logical connectives a bit further here. Each
has itw own few related inference rules. The rules for
implies (→) are unlike those for ∧. Those for ↔ on the
other hand are like those for ∧ but for the special case
where the two inputs to ∧ are of the forms (P → Q) and
(Q → P).

## Implies (→)

You can read the proposition, P → Q, as asserting that
*if P is true then so is Q.* What proves this kind of
proposition, and *implication*, to be true. Here's the
idea. Assume P is true, with a proof p. Now show that
from that p you can construct a proof of Q. That shows
that if P (as witnessed by a proof $p$) then Q is true,
too, as it's always possible to derive a proof of Q from
p.

So that's how you construct a proof of P → Q: provide a
*function* that converts any proof of P into a proof of Q!
That is it. And if you *have* a proof of *P → Q*, then you
can *apply* that proof/function to a proof of *P* to get a
proof of *Q*. That such a proof-converting function exists
shows that P implies Q! Indeed, we can see *andCommutes* as
a simple function, albeit one works on logical propositions
and proof objects, not ordinary data values such as strings
and Booleans. Here's an example.

In the mathematical system familiar to all
as natural number arithment, this proposition
is evidently true. In constructive mathematics
(including logic) we'll clearly want *1 + 1 = 2*
to be true, and it is, but is only because there
is a proof of it.

Where does that proof come from? The answer
is that it comes from a mathematical *axiom*
of logic we're learning, accepted just because
it capture the mathematical idea of equality.

The axiom says this: Suppose you have some
Type, call it α (pronouned alpha). Example:
α = Nat. Furthermore, suppose you have some
value, (a : α), of this type.

The equality introduction introduction rule
then stiplulates that there is always a proof
of the proposition, *a = a*. Think about it.
It just says, in matheamtical language, that
every object of every type is equal to itself.


Lean calls this inference rule, Eq.refl; but
we will use a shorthand for that called *rfl*.
The name comes from the idea that equality is
a *reflexive* relation: one under which every
object is related to itself.

Now we can see these ideas in action.

Here's what just happened. Lean evaluated the
term on the left, 1 + 1, by applying the *add*
operation (+) to 1 and 1, reducing the original
term, from 1 + 1 to 2. The term on the right is
already just 2. What is fundamentally needed is
a proof 2 = 2.

Voila, the equality introduction rule! It's also
just called *reflexivity*. In Lean it's called
Eq.refl. This inference rule has two arguments:
any type, α, and any value, (a : α), of that type.
Applying this rule to such arguments then yields
a term accepted axiomatically a proof of a = a.
Note carfully: a single



For equality propositions, in Lean, there
is a proof builder (inference rule) that
takes a single value (of any type) and
returns a proof that that value is equal
to itself. There is no other way to get
a proof of an equality in Lean.

### Iff (↔)

The *Iff (↔)* logical connective. P ↔ Q means that the
implication holds in both directions. We can express
this formally as (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P). P ↔ Q is equivalent
to (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P). Given two proofs, *pq : P → Q* and
*qp : Q → P*, *Iff.intro pq qp* constructs a proof of
*P ↔ Q*. In the other direction, if one assumed one has
a proof, (h : P ↔ Q), then (akin to And.left and And.right)
*h.mp : P → Q* and *h.mpr : Q → P*. Here *mp* is shorthand
for *modus ponens*, from the deductive logic of Aristotle.

Check it out. We'll assume we have proofs of both P → Q
and Q → P and we'll build a proof of P ↔ Q, then from
this proof we'll extract its left and right components,
which will be proofs of P → Q and Q → P in that order.

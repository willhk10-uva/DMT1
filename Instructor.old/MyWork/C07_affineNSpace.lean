## Scalars

Throughout the rest of this file, let α represent any type that
we intend to use as scalars, and let  *n* represent the dimension
of any tuple or vector or affine space we wish to construct.

Lean already knows a lot of the structures on such types as the
rational, ℚ. For example, Lean's libraries already enable it to
synthesize an *AddGroup* structure on ℚ. That means we already
have definitions of not only the standard arithmetic operations
(such as *add*, with notation *+*) on ℚ, but we also have *proofs*
of, e.g., all of the group axioms for ℚ (add is associative, etc).

## Fin n → α

Lean also has predefined algebraic structures on *Fin n → α*.
Here for example we confirm that Lean can synthesize an additive
group structure on (Fin n → α). That means first we can add, negate,
subtract, and scalar multiply (by Nat or Int) these things. Second,
we can have proofs of all the (here) *group axioms* for (Fin n → α).

/- @@@
There's more going on here than meets the eye. To synthesize a
group structure on *Fin n → α* depends on there being a group
structure on *α* itself. As an example, that (Fin n → α) tuple
encodings forms a group means the must be addition on (Fin n → α).
Lean defines that by *pointwise* addition using the addition that
is defined for the scalar type, α, requiring of course that there
also be an addition operation for individual α values. Of course
that is the case when α = ℚ, as we've already seen.

## Tuples: Tuple α n

The trick: strip abstractions, construct requirements in the
representation domain then impose the final output abstraction.
The extensionality principle is that two values are equal if their
representations are equal. With the @[ext] annotation you can use
the *ext* tactic to apply this principle, thus stripping the
proof need at the top level down to one needed at the level of
the underlying representation.

When you introduce notation like +, -, •, or +ᵥ, you’re really using syntactic sugar for
typeclass-based operations like HAdd, HSub, SMul, VAdd, VSub, etc. To support these notations
well, and make them usable in proofs, you should pair them with definition theorems that make
the meaning of the operation transparent to the simplifier, the rewriter, and the human reader.
Zero, like some other classes, is its own notation class.

providing by passing in an instance of the [Add α] class.

This is important. The *Add* class defines the arithmetic.
One should *also* instantial any separate *notation-defining*
class. The `+` notation is actually defined by the *HAdd*

Support for `+` notation using HAdd class. They key idea to
observe here is that we want the hAdd operation (addition
using `+`) to use precisely the same definition of Tuple
addition defined in the *Add* class. The pattern to use is
first to define the arithmetic class, and then to define
the notation class, ensuring that it's notational operator
is simply *delegating* to the actual arithmetic definition.
Follow this pattern thoughout, and going forward.

Finally, write a corresponding *definition theorem* to provide
a known basis for rewriting and simplifying expressions using
the concrete notation. If you want the *simp* tactic to know
about and use this rewriting rule, annotate the definition with

as to see exactly what's going on at all times.

#### Neg

Now another small complication. Not every arithmetic-defining
class, such as *Add*, has a separate notation class. There is
no separate notation defining class (which would presumably be
called *HNeg*) like there is for binary HAdd. Rather, the *-*
notation is provided by *Neg* itself. Separate notation classes
are used when there are both homogeneous versions of operations
(such as + : α → α → α) and heterogeneous (e.g., + : α → β → γ).
Unary negation, being unary, is always homogeneously typed, so
no separate notation class is needed or provided.

Yet more complexity: Lean will automatically infer an HSMul

does not automatically derive an *HAdd* instances from *Add*,

Here's a key example of lifing *proofs* from the
level of concrete representation to the level of
*Tuple* objects.

In particular, we'll prove that our tuples form an
additive, commutative semigroup, which is to say that
we'll construct proofs of the axioms for our *Tuples*
from corresopnding proofs for *Fin n → α*.

Those proofs, in turn, will come from an instance
of *AddCommSemigroup *(Fin n → α)* that Lean will
synthesize for us given that the necessary operations
are already available on scalar (α) values. For that,
we tell Lean to provide a *[AddCommSemigroup α]* class
instance, which it can also synthesize on its own.


The proofs of commutative and associativity of addition
on *Tuple* values are then constructed using the proofs
of the corresponding properties for (Fin n → α) concrete
representation objects.

strip the *Tuple* abstraction
using the extensionality axiom for *Tuple* then
apply the corresponding theorem from the level of
the concrete representation. The *ext* tactic is
enabled by the *@[ext]* annotation we've attached
to the *Tuple* type definition. Use *ext* instead
of *apply congrArg Tuple.mk*. Now you know what it
actually does.
@@@ -/
  add_comm := by
    intro a b
    simp [Tuple.add_def]

/- @@@
Here we see the use of our definition axiom. If
we replace *simp [Tuple.add_def]* with *ext* then
the extensionality principle will be applied, but
it will erase abstractions all the way to scalars,
not just one level to *Fin n → α*. Consistent with
our wanting a strictly layered architecture here,
we will prefer to strip abstractions just one level
and to use the proofs and values available there.

EXERCISE: Give it a try and in each case study the
goal after applying either variant. Hover over the
elements of the goal to see that in one case you've
got a proof to construct involving (Fin n → α) and
in the other case, involving scalars. There's an
*add_comm* proof available in either case, but one
applies to *Fin n → α* values while the other is on
bare *α* values. It's important to know exactly how
things are simplifying!
